I'm 20 years old and I specialize in automating data entry using python 3, geospatial anlalytics through R studio and ARCGIS.

This site acts as a portfolio for code I've written, currently it has snapshots of work I've done in R studio and python, using pycharm, although I'm proficient in multiple modelling softwares as well as having proficiency in HTML5, CSS, PHP, javascript and SQL as well as python and R studio.
