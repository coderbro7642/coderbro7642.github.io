# Ryan Mitchell

I'm Ryan Mitchell, I'm 20 years old and I specialize in automating data entry using python 3, geospatial anlalytics through R studio and ARCGIS.

This site acts as a portfolio for code I've written, currently it has snapshots of work I've done in R studio and python, using pycharm.
